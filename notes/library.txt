format is pretty easy - each row is 256b wide, data starts at 512b.

0b      - name
28b     - author
42b     - album
56b     - genre
70b     - track
148b    - format
168b    - fileId (64b of it, padded with zeros)

all strings are in tag format (more on it in playlist.txt)
i don't really know, what comes after the data. looks like some sort of string cache.
