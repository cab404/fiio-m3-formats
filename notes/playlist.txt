playlist :
start  size
0b     12b     playlist index
12b    4b      file format in ASCII
16b    80b     whole lot of file address octets
96b    2b      number of file address octets
98b    6b      C29F 686C C29F, not sure yet what is it. quite possibly just some padding, but that doesn't explain values.
104b   152b    name in standard tag format, possibly there is a smaller name length limit

all name/artist/whatever string tags are starting with 0xffef (0xfffe in BE) and ending with null terminator.
all of them are in UTF-16LE.

playlist index is something like 
0100 0000 0000 0100 1002 0000
0100 0000 0000 0200 1002 0000
0100 0000 0100 0300 1002 0000
0100 0000 0200 0400 1002 0000
0100 0000 0300 0500 1002 0000

first quartet has only availability flag - first byte is 01 when present and 02 otherwise.
and it doesn't do anything. at all ._.

second quartet has index and... index. yup.

third appears to have playlist id, or something of that sort.
it is probably saved in players internal somewhat, because changing it results in crash.
on clearing playlist it is replaced with a new one in some sort of internal device storage.

needs more research.

file id is actually more interesting than i thought - it starts with tailÂ byte octet - yes, whole octet. not quartet.
not sure why though. possibly because of end detection reasons?
maybe i am just an idiot, and there's some rfc telling that all fat32 files are addressed like that.

in playlists it appears that first byte after fs address and padding is number of octets in address, excluding border ones. e.g for
(2137 0a00 0001 0000) 0200 0000 a002 0000 0223 0700 8005 0000 (2137 0a00 0001 0000)
number will be 2.
